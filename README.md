## Render your React Components directly into custom HTML tags

This is a package that helps you use custom html tags to render your react components in.

You can apply html attributes to these custom html tags and the attributes will get passed through to your React Component as props.

## Installation

To install the package:

```bash
npm install react-render-custom-html-tag
```

To use package:

```javascript
import renderInCustomHtmlTag from 'react-render-custom-html-tag';
```

The function accepts two parameters:

```javascript
renderInCustomHtmlTag(Component, 'name-of-custom-component');
```

See code example for more details.

## Code Example

In Html set up your custom html tag. You can call this whatever you like, but in this example we are calling it `custom-htmltag`.

```html
<custom-htmltag></custom-htmltag>
```

In your react, import this package and use it when instantiating your class. Pass in the component as the first parameter the name of the custom html tag as a string as the second parameter (in this case: `'custom-htmltag'`).

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import renderInCustomHtmlTag from 'react-render-custom-html-tag';

class ExampleComponent extends React.Component {
    constructor(props){
        super(props);
    }


    render(){
        const props = this.props;

        return ()
            <React.Fragment>
                <h1>Hello World</h1>
            </React.Fragment>
        );
    }
}

renderInCustomHtmlTag(ExampleComponent, 'custom-htmltag')
```

And that should be it. Your React Component should be injected into the page.

### Attributes and Properties

On the custom html tag that you create you can also give it attributes that get passed through to the React component as properties, We also parse some of the values as json if possible.

```html
<custom-htmltag name="Jeff" data="{&quot;someProp&quot;:&quot;JSON parsed&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:2}"></custom-htmltag>
```

In your React Component you can get access to these by calling your props.

```javascript
const name = this.props.name; // string
```

```javascript
const data = this.props.data; // object
```

## Why?

We had a couple of project that we wanted to use react and sprinkle it through a normal html/php file. We found that our js started to fill up with a lot of **ReactDom.Renders**, with some vanilla js having to parse some of the properties that we wanted to pass into those components. So I build this, hopefully it helps some other people out.

## Source Examples

To run the example follow below.

```bash
npm install
```

Run the compiler

```bash
npm run build
```

Open up the **example/index.html** file in chrome and see how it works.
