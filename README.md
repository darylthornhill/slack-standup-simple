## Simple Slack standup

This package helps you do a stand up in a slack channel from the command line.

## Installation

To install the package:

```bash
npm install -g slack-standup-simple
```

To setup the package run the following command and answer the questions:

```bash
standup-standup-simple --init
```

You will need the channel, the web-hook url and your slack name.

To use the package:

```bash
standup-standup-simple
```

## Why?

We used to use a service for slack stand-ups and was dealing with typing everything manually. However I wanted something a little easier to run.
Instead of copying and pasting lots of yesterdays/todays/blockers.

## Future plans

I have already coded part of this however I want to display yesterdays answers along side the questions in the command line so we have reference of what we have done.
